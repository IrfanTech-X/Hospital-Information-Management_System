# 🏥 Hospital Management System

Welcome to the **Green University Hospital Management System** – a C++ console-based application designed to manage hospital operations like patients, doctors, and appointments. This project was developed with simplicity in mind to help students understand how real-world systems work using basic C++ concepts.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system simulates the core activities of a hospital through a menu-driven interface. It allows users to:
- Add, view, update, or delete **patient** records.
- Add, view, update, or delete **doctor** records.
- Schedule and manage **appointments**.
- View general **hospital information**.

> ✅ Perfect for beginner-level C++ learners and university assignments.
